# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to evaluate performance trends for various high schools based on student’s standardized test scores for math and reading. Certain test scores were removed on the basis of academic dishonesty, to preserve data integrity. The impact of removing test scores was also analyzed on the overall results.

## Results
### Impact on district summary
- The district school summary is impacted as we would have to discount the 461 student’s math and reading scores, therefore the average math scores, reading scores and percentage passing math, reading and overall would all be affected 

### Impact on school summary
- Originally Thomas high school’s math, reading and overall scores are evaluated to be much lower, once the ninth-grade averages are removed, these metrics significantly improve (see images below)

### Impact on Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools
-	Once removing the ninth-grade test scores, Thomas High School performs significantly better, appearing in the top 5 schools, whereas previously it would’ve performed closer to the bottom 5 (see images below)

### Impact on math and reading scores by grade
- No impact on scores from grades 10-12, but would impact the overall ninth-grade average with only 14 school’s scores being considered as opposed to 15

### Impact on scores by school spending 
- Impact the scores by student spending for the $630-$644 spending range, as this is where Thomas High School would be categorized – improve the average scores as Thomas High School performed significantly better than other schools in this category

### Impact on scores by school size
- Impact the scores by school size for Medium schools as this is where Thomas High School would be categorized – average scores for this category were consistently good (above % 80), had no adjustments been made to Thomas High Schools, the average for this size category would be negatively impacted 

### Impact on scores by school type
- Impact the scores by school type for Charter type schools – overall charter schools seem to outperform district with regards to grade averages, with remove ninth grade scores, it allowed Thomas High School to stay consistent with the mean

## Summary
Overall the performative analysis on the schools scores’ had four major impacts once Thomas High School ninth-grade math and reading scores were adjusted to reflect N/A values. The first major impact was the schools overall performance in comparison to the other 14 schools in the analysis. Once the ninth-grade scores were removed, Thomas High School was among the top 5 performing schools, where previously, it would not have been. Thomas High School’s overall ‘% Passing Math’, ‘% Passing Reading’ and ‘% Overall Passing’ were significantly impacted once scores were removed, they showed 66.9%, 69.7% and 65.1% respectively, prior to adjustments. Additionally, these adjustments would highly impact the math and reading scores by grade, specifically the ninth-grade scores, as 461 scores would not be available. Finally, this adjustment would a considerable impact on the schools by spending scores for the $630-$644 bucket, as well as the scores by school size for the medium schools.
